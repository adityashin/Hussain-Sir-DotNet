Unless and untill you can't achieve extra ordinary you will not get extra ordinary things.

It's an approach of re-implementing a parent classes method under the child with same signature.

Overloading:
1.In this case we define multiple methods with same name by changing their parameters.
2.This can be performed either within a class as well as between parent child classes also.
3. While overloading a parent classes method under the child class, child class doesn't requires to take any permission from the parent class.
4.Overloading is all about defining multiple behaviours to a method.

Overriding:
1.In this case we define multiple methods with the same name and same parameters.
2.This can be perfromed only between parent child classes can never be performed with in the same class.
3.while Overriding a parent's method under child class,child class requires a  permission from it's parent.
4.Overriding is all about changing the behaviour of parents method under child class.  

Note: If we want to override a parent's method under the child class, first that method should be declared by using the virtual modifier in parent class.

eg:
class1
public virtual void Test()    //Overridable

-Any virtual method of the parent class can be overriden by the child if required by using the override modifier.

class2 : class1
public override void Test()     //Overriding
