Interface:
class : it's a user-defined data type.
Interface = this is also a user-defined data type.

class : non-abstract methods(methods with method body)

abstract class: non-abstract methods(methods with method body)
and also abstract methods(methods without method body)
    
Interface : Contains only Abstract Methods(Methods without method body.)

The default scope the members of an interface is public whereas it's private in case of a class.

By default every member of an insterface is abstract so we don't require to use abstract modifier on it again just like we do in case of abstract class.

we can't declare any fields/variables under an interface
